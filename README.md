# ðŸ“‹ ClipCache

**ClipCache** is a fast, minimal clipboard history manager built with **Electron** and **React**. It runs quietly in the background and gives you searchable access to your clipboard history in a clean, responsive interface.

## Features

- Tracks clipboard history in the background  
- Persists clipboard entries across app restarts (each stored in a separate file)  
- Syntax highlighting for code snippets  
- Copy buttons and timestamps for all entries  
- Add, view, and remove tags for any clipboard entry  
- Filter clipboard history by tags or search query  
- System tray integration with quick access menu  
- Efficient lazy loading of clipboard history in batches to reduce memory usage and improve performance  
- Search across entire saved clipboard history (text + tags)  
- Cross-platform desktop support (Windows, macOS, Linux)


## Development Setup

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

This starts:
- Electron main process with TypeScript
- Vite dev server for the React frontend

Hot-reloading is enabled for both backend and frontend code.

## Building the App

To generate a production-ready version of the app:

```bash
npm run dist
```

This will:
- Build the Electron and frontend code
- Package the app using `electron-builder`
- Output the result in the `dist/` directory

Make sure icons (e.g., tray icon) are placed in the `assets/` folder and referenced correctly in `buildResources`. Note that the included icons were generated by ChatGPT.
